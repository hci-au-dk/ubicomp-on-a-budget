# Hack day zero
**Friday the 30th of November 2018, 13.00 - 15.00 in Ada-333**

**Participants: Cristian Remy, Sarah-Kristin Thiel, Andreas Mathisen, Jo Vermulen, Jens Emil Grønbæk, Henrik Korsgaard**

### Discussion points
1. The role of the hacker sessions: We should identify a few short projects to collaborate on during the sessions and avoid coming just to work on a personal/individual project. 
2. Relations to research: While the hack sessions are not intended as way to directly work on specific research contributions and prototypes, we hope the the critical mass of people, skills, ideas and enthusiasm will allow ideas to foster that in some form or another can become research.
3. Installing and working with webstrates: We discussed different approaches to working with webstrates to avoid too much tooling and setting up personal webstrate servers. Henrik promised to provide a few guides on installing and working with webstrates in prototyping.
4. Potential shared projects: We discussed a few ideas for shared projects to work on in the comming events. We did not make a shared decisions (the ideas started coming towards the end). We will discuss this starting the next session.

### Emerging ideas

#### Turning multiple office-displays into a large canvas
We have seen and discussed the small prototype office displays developed by Jens Emil and Henrik. Based on these we wanted to a) create more and allow people to appropriate them and b) have a way to aggregate and control a number of these to offer interesting forms of interacting with the entire hallway. E.g. Andreas proposed that one could define a mode before entering a hall-way, e.g. an exhibition mode show-casing latest research (CHI videos). Sarah (and Jens Emil) suggested different ways of following the user as one walk along the hallway.

This idea require that we have 4 or more office-displays / tablets to demo interactions on and a small infrastructure that can centralise the control of the displays for a given period. 

Based on a quick summary discussion after the hack session, Jens Emil and Henrik will propose that this is the first shared project for the coming sessions.

#### An "If This Then That" approach to designing interactions
As we quickly started talking about coupling several prototypes (or ideas) across the rooms and hallways, we ended up discussing how to allow people to sketch and configure interactions using the If-This-Then-That approach. This approach allow us to connect diverse forms of input like data mined from existing systems (e.g. calendars), sensing input (proxemics etc.) and explicit user input (e.g. signing into a room or using a place-specific prototype) with equally different forms of output (displays, audio, lights). We discussed a few small examples:

1. Small notification when a co-worker is available: "If X in office, then blink my desk lamp"
2. Small notification when more than 6 people are in the coffee room: "If more than 6 is in room, play sound"
3. Group call-outs when going to lunch or Friday bar: "When button pressed, play group notification"

Aside from quickly becoming a larger research project in itself (more than 2 in more than 2 years), we also discussed the difference between implicit (e.g. sensing) and explicit (e.g. checking in) tracking when trying to establish presence and privacy aspects related to this. E.g. do Bob give Alice permission to design interactions based on data pertaining to his movemements etc.

A few of us discussed that we should consider aspect of the idea when developing prototypes, however, given the work it might require, it should not be the first shared project.
