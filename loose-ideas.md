# Loose ideas

In this document, people can dump their ideas whenever they come up with them outside the hack sessions:

- (Jens Emil) __A slide type: Acamedic thoughts__ - All phd students in the journal club have filled out [Nine Questions for HCI Researchers in the Making](http://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/july-august-2016/nine-questions-for-hci-researchers-in-the-making). On the public display that will be deployed in the Hopper-1 kitchen in January, we could have a 'slide type' that would present a random quote/thought by a researcher that could spark discussion and reflection among us as researchers. Students' answers to the nine questions inspired me to this idea, and I think our answers have already curated the first long list of thoughts/reflections related to research.
