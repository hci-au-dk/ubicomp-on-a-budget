## Principles of the hacks

### 1. Leave your research at the door
We recognise that your research is important and have priority. We welcome you to join with the expertiese and knowledge you have, but would kindly ask you to leave your current research mindset "at the door". This means:
    
    1. Don't kill ideas by asking what is the research contribution
    2. Don't question ideas as novel
    3. Don't expect everyone to work on or buy into _your_ research ideas
    4. Allow stuff to evolve and grow within the community

### 2. Free of use information
Any information, idea, code, concept etc. share within the hack sessions is free of use. Coordinate and be inclusive if:
    1. Consider

### 3. Do-ocracy
